# EEG anomaly detection 
  The expeiment uses NMT dataset for EEG classification using models based on Deep and Shallow CNN architechtures proposed by 
  R. T. Schirrmeister et al in `Deep  learning  with  convolutional  neural  networks  for  EEG  decodingand  visualization`
## Run
1. Modify config.py, especially correct data folders for your path..
2. Run with `python ./auto_diagnosis.py`
##
## Acknowledgment 
The shallow and Deep CNN experiments are built on example provided for BrainDecode by â€ªRobin Tibor Schirrmeister here
